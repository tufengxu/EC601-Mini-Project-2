Summary of group reports

Jialun Wang report
This report focuses on an unsupervised learning algorithm, K-Means algorithm. K-Means is a mainstream algorithm in unsupervised learning. K-Means is convenient and more efficient to process spherical datasets without preset labels. But it requires a appropriate K to get the good results.

Zeyu Song report
This report focuses on object detection and R-CNN methods. This report analyzes the pros of Fast/Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. These methods are keeping improving, together with fast training and inference time.

Cagri Yoruk report
This report focuses on object detection and many models, like YOLO, R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN. Compared them by their architecture, system performance, the implementation styles, and the relation between these models.

Qing Han report
This report focuses on YOLO system. This report analyzes the pros and cons of YOLO compared to other systems, especially in real-time object detection tasks. YOLO is much faster in real-time object detection than other systems.
